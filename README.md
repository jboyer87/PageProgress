# PageProgress

A JavaScript/CSS module for adding a progress bar to long pages.

## Features

**Save your place** -- Allows users to save their spot on your page and return to the same place when they visit again. This is useful for longer articles where a user might start reading and then return later to finish up.

**Progress bar** -- A visual cue in the form of a progress bar is added to the top of the page to show the user how far they have progressed through the page.
